## Items to discuss

### Prototype

Open the <b>prototype-v3</b> folder and <b>index.html</b> file.

This latest version of the interactive prototype is populated with dummy content to replicate the feel of the site. We are still discussing <i>content</i>, NOT <i>design</i> at this stage, but we can start talking about some layout issues at this point.

I’ll be writing up a useability testing plan, which I’ll share with you before we start conducting tests.

I’ve created a Google spreadsheet for us to fill out any issues, both from our own testing and as a result of useability testing.

I’ll create a spreadsheet template for us to use in evaluating testing participants’ feedback.
