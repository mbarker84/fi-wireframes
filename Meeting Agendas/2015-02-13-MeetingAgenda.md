## Items to discuss

### Site map
* Review updated site map. Are we all on the same page?

### Homepage
* Are we happy with the content for these pages? Anything else to add?
* What about the navigation and search function?

### Blog
* Are we happy with the content for these pages? Anything else to add?
* What about the navigation and search function? Included option to highlight 3 latest speakers / contributors and browse all contributors.
* ‘Sign up to the newsletter’ CTA – is this the best place for it? Allows us to keep it consistent throught the site, and out the way of the main content.

### Video pages
* Assess content and navigation / search. Think about how users will journey around the site.
* Public / members–only video access: Some events will have a mixture of public <i>and</i> private videos. Use symbols to denote ‘locked’ videos, with a call-to-action inviting people to become a member by signing up for a video pass. Think about how we want to word this.
* Do we want a button to ‘View free videos only’? Abandoned this idea, as we want people to see what they’re missing. But we need to make it clear that you can still view a lot of video content without becoming a member – don’t want to put people off exploring!
* Logging in or becoming a member:
    - How do we want to word this: Buy a video pass? Become a member? What are we offering?
    - What types of video passes are available? 1-year? Per event?
    - People who are already members or have been to an event: How long does membership last? One year? Forever? If your membership has expired (e.g. you last attended an event two years ago) are you still technically a member but don’t have access to the latest videos?
    - Do some research into how membership flow works for other sites, e.g. Treehouse.
* Do we want to include the ‘Signup to the Newlsetter’ CTA on the video pages? We would need to give them the option to select FOWD or FOWA, as the video pages cover all Future Insights content.

### Speaker page (home)
* Navigation – simpler than video page.
* ‘Speaker Spotlight’ section on main page (speakers-main.html) highlights a particular speaker with an exerpt from their bio, inviting the viewer to explore more.
* CTA moved to bottom – seems less relevant for the speaker page to have it at the top, distracting from main content.

### Speaker page (single)
* Highlights content on this speaker and invites the viewer to explore more (similar topics / speakers).

### Next steps
* Still to do:
    - Individual blog post page
    - Individual video page
* Convert to interactive prototypes to test and get feedback.
