#Wireframes for new Future Insights site

View the document <b>index.html</b> in your browser.

This document is NOT designed as a representation of the actual look of the product. It is designed purely for the team to assess the content for the proposed new site, decide what is needed and <b>roughly</b> where in the flow of the page we want the various content blocks to be visible to users.

###Goals

The aim of the new website is to sell tickets for Future Insights events. The secondary aims are to encourage longer visits to the site and signup to the newsletter (the result of which will be increased ticket sales).

###Proposal

The proposal is to build a site that encourages greater participation by users and the web community. This would include a ‘content library’ comprising a blog, video library (with public and private levels of access) and speaker database, featuring up-to-date speaker bios and speaking appearances.

The team should consider and discuss:

1. Which content blocks are necessary on the homepage.
2. Can / should any content blocks be moved to their own subpage or become part of another subpage?
3. Can / should we expand on any of these content blocks, or combine additional content?
4. What content do we want to omit altogether?
5. Navigation: What items do we want to include in the top-level navigation? Are there currently too many?
6. What are the main Calls-to-Action?
