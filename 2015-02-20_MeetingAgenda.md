## Items to discuss

### Prototype

This interactive prototype is designed to test how well the user can journey around the site and discover the content they want. The content blocks are respresentations of roughly where in the flow of the page a user would encounter these elements – it does not represent a final design or layout.

Open the file <b>index.html</b> in the ‘Prototype’ folder.

Navigation:
* Please consider this in particular as you’re moving around the site. What (if anything) is missing? How could it be improved?
* Use of dropdown menus – pros and cons. Effective at keeping the main menu to a manageable length.

Mobile content audit:
* Test the prototype at mobile sizes, make sure we’re happy with the content flow. Does anything need re-ordering?

Single blog post:
* Do we want to include ‘Comments’ section?

Footer:
* What do we want to include?
    - Social icons
    - Contact info (company email and phone number?)
    - Link to company / about page?
    
### Still to do
* Future Insights home (see about.html)
* About page
* Contact info

### Next steps
* Adjust (temporary) copy if needed.
* Test prototype internally (Future Insights and WIS), note any questions, reactions or areas of concern.
* Start generating ideas for UI design.
