## Items to discuss

### Site map
* Does everyone understand the content flow throughout the site? Does it sufficiently represent the user’s journey?
* Have we represented all the main content pages we want to include? Are there any pages we want to add / omit?

### Homepage wireframe
* Have we represented all the content blocks necessary for the homepage?
* Can / should any content blocks be moved to their own subpage or become part of another subpage?
* Can / should we expand on any of these content blocks, or combine additional content?
* What content do we want to omit altogether?
* Navigation: What items do we want to include in the top-level navigation? Are there currently too many?
    - Methods for ensuring the top-level navigation doesn’t get too bloated.
* What are the main Calls-to-Action?

### Blog wireframe
* Assess content: Anything we want to add / omit?
* How will the blog co-exist with the rest of the content library (e.g. videos)? Do we want the ability to filter by content type? Separate menu?
* Bear in mind that many users will come to our site via the blog, rather than the homepage. Therefore, who we are and what we do should be obvious to the visitor.

### About page wireframe
* Are all these sections necessary? We should look at data from the current site, which pages are visited most / least often.
* Should some of these sections be moved to homepage?
* Do we need a sub-menu?
* Radical thought: Do we even need this page at all?

### Next steps
* Content wireframes for the remaining top-level pages.
* Working these up into interactive prototypes for testing.
